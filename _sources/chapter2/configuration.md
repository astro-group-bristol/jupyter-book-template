# Book configuration

A Jupyter Book is configured by editing the `src/_config.yml` file. This template configures sensible defaults, but some fields should be changed to match your uses:

```yaml
# Title and Author as needed
title: "Astro Group Bristol Template"
author: "Astro Group Bristol"

# ...

# Information about where the book exists on the web
repository:
  url: https://github.com/astro-group-bristol/jupyter-book-template
  branch: main

# ...
```

Full documentation for how to configure your book can be read on the [Jupyter Book homepage](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html).
